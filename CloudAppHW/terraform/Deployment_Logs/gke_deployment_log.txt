  Cloud Services
      ▪ Promoted gcloud beta services enable command to beta to enable
        services for a given project, folder, or organization.

        **Note**: The organization policy constraint
        `constraints/serviceuser.services` may not work correctly if you enable a
        service at the folder or organization level using Service Usage with
        Hierarchical Service Activation. To recreate the same behavior in a
        compatible way, it is recommended to replace
        `constraints/serviceuser.services` with the Restrict Resource Service Usage
        organization policy.

        **Note**: Previously, enabling some services also triggered service account
        creation. This logic is now separate. If you encounter a service account not
        found error, please report this to service-usage-feedback@google.com. You
        can use `gcloud services enable` or `gcloud beta services identity create`
        to create the necessary service account.

        **Note**: The command will now return an error if the user attempts to
        enable a service that is already enabled.

      ▪ Promoted gcloud beta services disable command to beta to disable
        services for a given project, folder, or organization.

        **Note**: When disabling a service with Hierarchical Service Activation,
        existing consumer-controlled resources can block the process. Please delete
        these resources and try again. If resources cannot be deleted, report the
        issue to the respective service team. Alternatively, use the Restrict
        Resource Service Usage organization policy constraint to restrict service
        access.

        **Note**: The command will now return an error if the user attempts to
        disable a service that is not enabled.

      ▪ Promoted gcloud beta services list command to beta to list Google
        Cloud services and APIs that are enabled or available for a given
        project, folder, or organization.

        **Note**: Some services previously hidden may now appear in the enabled
        list with Hierarchical Service Activation. This does not necessarily mean
        they were newly enabled. They can be disabled using `gcloud beta services
        disable` if desired.* Promoted `gcloud services groups list-members` command to beta to list the direct members of a specified service dependency group.

      ▪ Promoted gcloud services groups list-members command to beta to list
        the direct members of a specified service dependency group.
      ▪ Promoted gcloud services groups list-expanded-members command to beta
        to list all transitive members, including nested dependencies, within a
        service dependency group.
      ▪ Promoted gcloud services policies get command to beta to retrieve the
        consumer policy for the given project, folder, or organization.
      ▪ Promoted gcloud services policies get-effective command to beta to
        retrieve the effective consumer policy for the given project, folder,
        or organization, including policies inherited from ancestors.
      ▪ Promoted gcloud services policies test-enabled command to beta to
        test if a service value is enabled for the given project, folder, or
        organization, including policies inherited from ancestors.
      ▪ Promoted gcloud services policies update command to beta to update
        the consumer policy for the given project, folder, or organization
        using a provided file.

        **Note**: Please refer to <https://docs.cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/hierarchical-service-activation/overview> for more details on hierarchical service activation.
